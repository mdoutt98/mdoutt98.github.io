                 We were all a bit giddy setting off and made it a whole quarter mile before we saw some bamboo, which caused us to stop
                for pictures. Peter successfully did a human flag in his America pants, which was very exciting. Since we were off to a
                late start, we only made it 30 miles, but got to see some picturesque rivers and forests. We were a bit late getting
                into the national park, so it was dark and cold, but on the bright side we saw several deer right on the path, and even
                got some blurry footage of them.
                
                At the national park, we were fortunate to meet the Grace Covenant Presbyterian group that was staying there. They
                offered us a spot to pitch our tents on their campsite, and helped Charlie pitch his tent, which he was having some
                trouble with. It was a good, if short, start to the trip.

                The Grace Covenent Presbyterian group spoiled us with a hot breakfast of pancakes, bacon, and omelettes in the morning.
                After eating and hanging out with them a bit, we hit the road around 9.
                
                We made good time through the countryside surrounding Richmond. We saw a lot of signs for plantations and monuments to
                people like John Tyler, one of the less interesting Presidents. We got lost for over an hour around midday, causing us
                to lose time, but some helpful locals pointed us in the right direction. This was unfortunately along a busy highway, so
                we walked our bikes a few miles rather than hazard the traffic.
                
                As dusk fell we weren’t near any large towns, but luckily the pastor of Mount Olivet Baptist Church was still there and
                allowed us to camp on their property. We ended up in the small barn they use for nativity scenes, lending the night a
                weird kind of symbolism.

                We left before church started at 8:15 and once again were making great progress through some beautiful farmland, until
                Charlie’s chain broke (through no fault of his own). We spent about two hours on some guy’s lawn trying to fix it.
                Several people offered help, but we were sure we could handle it. We finally gave up after two heartbreaking near-fixes.
                
                At that point, we decided to accept the help of Sapphyre, a very cool passerby who had left her number. She drove to
                pick us up and took us back to Twin Oaks community, which is one of the oldest conscientious living communities in
                America. We got to meet DH, who fixed Charlie’s chain in about 5 minutes, and another community member who had biked to
                California and back.
                
                After our interesting side trip, we still managed 85 miles on the day and spent the night in Charlottesville. The Budget
                Inn has never seemed nicer.

            We got off to a late start because we had to go to a bike shop to get Charlie’s chain looked at. After stocking up on
            repairs/supplies at the bike shop, we had a delicious lunch at Chipotle and finally started biking around 1:30.
            We had a tough climb up the mountains to get on the Blue Ridge Parkway, but were rewarded with some breathtaking views.
            After a hard afternoon, we made it to a peak at 3200 feet where we made camp at a picnic site off the side of the
            parkway.

            We were trying to make it as close to Blacksburg as possible to stay the night with the Saackes, so we left early in the
            morning around 7:15. We had a nice, long descent, and spent midmorning at Gertie’s Country store. We met some friendly
            locals who were interested in our trip, as well as Gary, an Irishman and fellow transamerican cyclist. We signed our
            names on the wall of the store to go with the hundreds of other signatures of travelers from around the world.
            
            The rest of the day was rolling hills, and very hot, but we managed to average ~17 mph for a lot of it. By around mile
            85 we were starting to feel tired, but we pushed on the last ~20 miles a slower pace.
            
            Finally we reached our meeting point where Dr. Saacke came to pick us up. He and Mrs. Saacke were wonderful hosts,
            giving us as much pasta as we could eat and giving us much needed access to laundry and shower facilities. We all
            collapsed into bed around 10, exhausted but very happy to be here.

            We had a delicious breakfast with the Saackes. We were tired from the day before and really enjoying their hospitality,
            so we stayed late and also had a delicious lunch.
            We finally left around 2:30 and had a relaxed day going mostly downhill. As the day drew to a close, Matt was very
            excited to see the first Dairy Queen of the trip. We finally pitched camp at the max meadows fire station. The
            firefighters there were very friendly and showed us their fireman suits. They even offered to let is use their showers,
            but we declined, since showers on two days in a row is pretty excessive.

            We broke camp early from the fire station and set out to make up some mileage. Mount Rogers is officially the best
            mountain; it goes up at a moderate incline, and the downhill lasts forever. We had some ice cream in Damascus that was
            possibly even better than at Dairy Queen.
            Our day ended with the pleasant discovery of a church with it’s doors open to cyclists. There are Dutch cyclists we
            didn’t see much, as well as two fellow Americans. Eric just graduated from CMU in philosophy and said he was biking
            across the country to “put off real life for as long as possible,” and because he likes to travel. Al is a 63 year old
            engineer from Long Island who said he was biking across the country “because I’m old.” We were impressed with their
            fortitude for doing the trip solo.

        After endless hills and lots of gas station food, we finally made it to Kentucky. Along the way we stopped at Breaks
        Interstate Park, whose incredible views almost made up for it’s disgustingly steep climbs.
        We spent the night at the Frieda Harris Baptist Center, which hosts cyclists and provides showers, food, and a
        basketball court, all for free. Thanks to this wonderful hospitality, we spent the evening enjoying a pathetic game of
        basketball and chef Charlie’a famous extra-watery Mac n cheese.
        We also met Reed and Ethan, two fellow cyclists staying the night. They are brothers from Arizona, ages 16 and 21. They
        were very friendly and we traded tips on how to escape the rampant unleashed dogs that chase our bikes. We were also
        impressed with the fundraising they were doing for the children’s hospital in Phoenix.

        After a final homemade breakfast of canned beans and milk, we left the Freeda Harris Baptist Center hoping the worst of
        the hills were behind us. Two miles into our ride, we hit a formation that blurred the distinction between a hill and a
        cliff and continued for at least a half mile. As we strained up the cliff/hill in our lowest gear, we passed several
        other cyclists walking their bikes up.
        At the top, we talked with the other cyclists and discovered they were with a tour group of 16 people and doing the same
        route as us. This would be the first of many encounters throughout the day with the Adventure Cycling group, and Matt
        soon made it his mission to catch them all. Among the more interesting members of their party was a man from England who
        found American wildlife, such as roadkill raccoons and roadkill skunks very exotic. We also met a retired couple riding
        a tandem bike who informed us that they had crossed the country twice before by bike, and that the route we were on was
        by far the worst terrain-wise.
        After this less than encouraging exchange, we were pleased to spend most of the rest of the day going downhill. There
        was even a driver who met us at a gas station who apologized very earnestly for having passed us rudely earlier in the
        day. Though we did not remember the incident in question, the sentiment was appreciated and raised our opinion of
        Kentucky.
        We ended the day in a town with the colorful name of Hazard. We stayed at the Combs Motel, which was vaguely reminiscent
        of the Bates Motel from Psycho. After a dinner of Chinese buffet, we felt very pampered nonetheless.

        We left Hazard a bit late around 9:45. The forecast called for the first rain of the trip, which materialized about 15
        miles into the trip. We huddled under cover at a gas station with several of the adventure cycling guys. One of the
        cyclists we met somewhat gleefully displayed his hobby of supergluing pennies to various locations. He informed us that
        he was attempting to glue pennies throughout the route, which struck Charlie as very subtly diabolical, and Matt as
        awesome.
        After wiring out the worst of the rain, we traveled over several hills, which were gradually starting to get smaller. We
        entered an awkward cycle of passing with the Adventure Cyclists, with is slowly passing them on the uphills, and them
        passing us as we cautiously rode our brakes on the wet downhills. Who would have thought 60 year old men would be more
        reckless than a group of college students? It took all of our self control not to race and chase them down.
        Due to the rain, we decided to end the day early in McKee. There we found the second Dairy Queen of the trip, leading an
        excited Matt to make the goal of getting a blizzard at every DQ on our route. We spent the night at yet another motel,
        which makes us officially spoiled

            The day started with THE BEST HILL EVER. Outside of Berea, the road extended downhill at 6 percent grade for two miles
            (we know because there was a sign), and the road was silky smooth with no traffic. We were all exhilarated after five
            minutes of flying down, and our mood was further lifted as we rode through the beautiful town of Berea. We gorged at a
            pizza buffet and set off through the increasingly modest hills with a much higher view of Kentucky, which had been at a
            low through the unleashed dog infested Appalachians.
            After lunch, we accidentally made our first big wrong turn since Virginia. Though nobody was at fault, Peter did have
            the maps and was the one telling us where to turn. Not to point any fingers, but we can probably say with certainty that
            Charlie and Matt did nothing wrong.
            After realizing Peter’s the mistake, we decided to make lemonade from our navigational lemons and make our route into a
            shortcut. Though at times we had to ride on about a foot of shoulder, we actually ends up making good time on an ever
            flatter landscape. By 7:30, we pulled into the campground at Bardstown (DQ count: 4), having biked about 108 miles and
            shaving 10 miles from the designated route. Overall, it was probably our best day of biking yet.

            Leaving Bardstown, we passed several of the famous distilleries that make the area “the Napa Valley of bourbon.” We are
            still a bit more excited for the real Napa Valley.
            For breakfast we stopped at the only gas station for several miles, which unfortunately was a decrepit store that didn’t
            even sell gas anymore. After feasting on nuts and Doritos, we were less than pleased to discover the “blue sugar” on the
            muffins we bought was actually mold, and the nuts were expired. Though disgusted, we thankfully didn’t get sick (yet).
            Thereafter we made good time through pretty but slightly monotonous countryside. We stopped at a library at 4 so Charlie
            could work some on his dental school application. We were initially worried because the library closed at 4:30, but
            luckily we had just passed the time zone line, so we gained an extra hour. Someone should use this as a plot device in a
            movie.
            Though we had initially planned to go all the way to Mammoth Cave, we decided to stay in Cave City after determining
            that the Econolodge there was half the cost of lodging at Mammoth Cave.
            We also discovered that our mileage count was a bit off. As of day 12, we have traveled 909 miles, giving us an average
            of over 75 miles a day. Considering this included a half day on the first day, getting used to biking, and some rough.
            terrain, we are more optimistic now of reaching our goal of 85 miles a day average.
            Edit: the anonymous woman who bought us dinner at the Chinese buffet deserves a shoutout. 50 points to Kentucky.

            After the uninspiring complementary breakfast at the Econolodge, we made the short ride over to Mammoth Cave. Over the
            course of our two hour tour, we learns I interesting tidbits, like that mammoth cave has 400 miles of explored
            passageways, or that it was set up as a fallout shelter during the cold war. We were also treated to 200 years of
            graffiti, including the pre-1950 “historical graffiti” and the pat-1950 “federal offenses.”
            Matt was so enthused he took a second tour, while Charlie and Peter blogged and listened to Taylor Swift, respectively.
            After we had our fill of the national park, we set off for a bit of biking to round out the day. We passed several Amish
            farms and buggies, reminding us of Pennsylvania. As the sun set, e took refuge in a pavilion outside a Methodist church
            and prepared for the coming thunderstorms. Matt took great pride in his ability to set up his tent on the concrete, but
            everyone else accomplished the same feat without too much trouble. Still, sometimes you just have to let the mechanical

        After weathering a nighttime thunderstorm under the pavilion at the Methodist Church, we set off early to try to make
        the 120 mile long haul to the well-regarded bike lodging in Utica. Fortunately, “Master Navigator” Charlie noticed a
        fairly large chunk of the route could be cut off. This time we made sure of our “shortcut” by conferring with an
        extremely friendly gas station owner (as we were thanking him, he replied that “anyone with as much drive as y’all is
        going to be a senator or something, so just remember me when you do”). Ultimately, our new route saved about 15 miles
        and made the day much more manageable.

            By now, we are like a well-oiled mileage machine. We left Utica around 8:30 and zipped through relatively flat farmland
            towards the Ohio River. There we took an old-fashioned ferry across, giving us some time to chat with fellow passengers.
            They were thoughtful enough to warn us about some college age bikers, one of whom had died a couple years ago on the
            same route as us after being hit by a van. This did not inspire confidence.
            
            After crossing the river into Illinois we found to our dismay that this part of Illinois was in fact quite hilly. As a
            friendly local who gave us water put it, “in Hardin county, if you’re not going up a hill, you’re going down one.”
            
            We finally rolled into Elizabethtown around 7 ready to call it a day. We paid $7 apiece to pitch our tents in the yard
            of a bed and breakfast and use their showers and electricity. Once we had showered (two days in a row!), we went to the
            highly recommended cafe located on a barge on the Ohio river. Matt and Peter feasted on all you can eat fried catfish
            (fresh caught), while vegetarian Charlie got by on large helpings of beans, cole slaw, and potato salad. After dinner,
            we ran back to avoid the swarms of mosquitoes and passed out in our tents, very content.

            We wound up leaving late in the morning because we stopped at another recommended local restaurant for breakfast. After
            spoiling ourselves with omelettes, pancakes, and fried okra, we finally hit the road around 9:30.
            
            Though we made good time once we got out of Hardin County, we were once again slowed when we stopped for lunch at
            Delaney’s, a restaurant in Goreville that offers free dessert to cyclists. We gorged on fries, burgers, and potato
            salad, but still found room for the promised dessert. Matt got oreo pie, and proceeded to rub in Peter and Charlie’s
            face how delicious it was while refusing to share any. When Peter and Charlie’s milkshakes arrived, they in turn enjoyed
            the ice-creamy goodness with very expressive noises and facial expressions. Though no agreement could be reached on who
            had had the best treat, everyone left Delaney’s very satisfied.
            
            After very slowly biking off the big lunch, we passed through the beautiful Crab Orchard Wildlife Refuge. We had no
            choice but to stop and take excessive pictures of the sparkling blue lake and vibrant greenery surrounding it. Matt was
            so enamored of the natural beauty that he wanted to go skinny dipping, but the steady stream of pickup trucks going be
            and the prospect of leeches in the water ultimately dissuaded him.
            
            After these stops we were running a bit behind the planned schedule for the day, but after the wildlife refuge we sped
            along some very flat highways and still made it to Murphysboro before dark. We decided to rough it and camp in the
            nearby Lake Murphysboro State Park rather than get a motel. Though highly mosquito-infested, the park was very pretty
            and we found an unused campsite with some comfy moss to pitch our tents. The weather forecast didn’t call for rain, so
            we left our tentflaps off and fell asleep under the stars.

            We woke up at sunrise and got an early start towards the Mississippi. We were making good time over flat terrain, but we
            almost missed our turn towards Chester. Some helpful churchgoers pointed us in the right direction, but expressed doubt
            that we could make it “all the way to Farmington” (60 miles) before dark (spoiler: we made it to Farmington well before
            dark).
            
            After passing through Chester, the home of Popeye, we crossed a bridge over the swollen Mississippi river into the
            promised flatlands beyond. Unfortunately, the promised flatlands soon gave way to the foothills of the Ozarks, and to
            add to this unpleasant surprise, a brief thunderstorm pelted us with hail and soaked us to the bone. After about an hour
            of reprieve, another thunderstorm came and soaked us once again.
            
            We finally reached Farmington around 4:30 and made for a hostel set up specifically for bikers on the Transamerica
            Trail. We could not figure out how to get in at first, but after a lot of pounding on the door, a fellow tourer from
            Montreal came out of the building and showed us the back entrance. Yvan was in the midst of an 8000 mile tour all over
            the US and Canada and was sharing a skype birthday dinner with his wife in Montreal. We commended him for his ambitious
            trip, but he wisely reminded us to be proud of our own trip but to remember that there was always someone who was doing
            more.
            
            After freshening up, we met with Charlie’s Aunt Julie and Uncle Bill, who had very kindly driven down from St. Louis to
            meet us for dinner. We went to Spokes, where we feasted on burgers and pizza (except for Uncle Bill, who got his usual
            chicken caesar) and talked to them about our trip. Afterwards, we still had enough room to travel to the nearby Dairy
            Queen (DQ count: 6) for blizzards. In keeping with family tradition, Charlie managed to buy his own blizzard before Aunt
            Julie could insist on paying.
            
            After bidding Aunt Julie and Uncle Bill farewell, we settled in to a luxurious night on beds with plans to sleep in.
            Having reached Missouri, the West is finally starting to seem within reach.

            We began the day with an incredibly luxurious sleep-in to 8. Matt was feeling very ambitious and tried to go on a run,
            but “everything hurt” at first, so he ended up doing sprint-walk intervals. Meanwhile at the hostel, Peter climbed the
            support pole and explored the abandoned loft, and Charlie blogged.
            Upon finally hitting the road around noon, we decided to conservatively aim for Ellington, since it supposedly had nice
            biker lodging.
            We coasted through a pretty mix of farmland and pine forest. In a lot of ways, the ride could have been through any of
            the eastern states we’re accustomed to, but the transition to Missouri was clearly demarcated by a change in the road
            kill from possums and skunks to turtles and armadillos.
            After our brief but pleasant ride, we arrived in Ellington to find that nobody had heard of the “Jesus is Lord
            Fellowship” that was listed on the map as hosting cyclists. Unable to locate or contact our planned hosts, we settled
            for a makeshift dinner at a Dollar General (our new favorite store) and camping at a park recommended by a local.
            As we settled down for the night, we were disconcerted to learn from a passerby that a bear had recently been sighted in
            the area. We moved all of our food away from our tents and spent a tense night primed for any sign of a bear. Our nerves
            were not helped by a stray dog that showed up around midnight and started knocking over trash cans. Eventually, we made
            it to the morning without getting eaten.

        We set off in the morning with high hopes for making up the previous day’s low mileage, but ran into problems almost
        immediately when Matt’s inner tube popped (as did the first replacement tube he tried to put in). After overcoming this
        setback, we were just getting into our push through the Ozarks when one of Matt’s spokes broke, leaving his bike’s road
        worthiness questionable. Undeterred, we pressed on only to hit the steepest hills of the Ozarks on a cloudless, 95
        degree day. After hours of boiling in the sun, we were drenched in sweat and unhappy with the life choices that had
        landed us in this hell.
        Fortunately, our attitudes took a dramatic swing for the better when we finally arrived in Summersville and decided to
        invest in some much needed ice cream. We bought a half gallon of “bunny tracks” (vanilla with chocolate and fudge), and
        wasted no time in devouring the whole thing. It was heaven.
        As we ate, a steady stream of people stopped by to chat. One woman, upon hearing we were going to San Francisco,
        reminded us that we were “not even close.” Another man stepped out of the grocery to engage us in friendly conversation,
        complete with enthusiastic gestures, all while holding a menacing looking kitchen knife.
        After our refreshing interlude in Summersville, we pushed on to Houston (Missouri) and decided we had earned a stop and
        a motel. To cap off a hard day of riding, we ate delicious Mexican food while the waiter chatted with us about our trip.
        With our bellies stuffed and our bodies tired, we collapsed into bed around 10.

        Since we were a bit behind on mileage, we decided to leave quickly in the morning and power out a long day of riding.
        For once, the day went off without a hitch, but unfortunately this leaves few interesting anecdotes.
        We rode steadily through some rolling hills that marked the end of the Ozarks and emerged into the vast, sparsely
        inhabited farmland of the plains. We passed landmarks with heartening names like “turnback creek” and ate at the far
        flung gas stations of the region.
        The one notable event of the day was a near-tragic encounter with yet another pack of unleashed dogs. As we’ve
        experienced since western Virginia, a couple of dogs saw us biking past their yard and came sprinting g into the road
        barking at us. This time, unfortunately, a car came from the other direction. Matt yelled and put up his hand, causing
        the driver to slow down, but they still bumped one of the dogs at low speed. The dog walked away and seemed fine, but it
        was scary nonetheless.
        After nearly an hour of biking past farm fields and few signs of civilization, we finally found a chapel to camp at just
        as dusk was falling. We braved the swarming bugs to get our tents up quickly, and laid inside as the stars came out,
        waiting for it to cool down enough to sleep.

            We got up at 6, hoping to make it to Pittsburg (Kansas) in time to get Matt’s spoke fixed at the bike shop. The land was
            extremely flat, so we made quick time through the last couple of towns before a 60 mile stretch with only one town. We
            geared up for this long haul with a 2nd breakfast at a not-so-classy bar in Everton, “The Shaved Beaver.” After enjoying
            some breakfast burritos and an episode of “The $25,000 Pyramid,” we set off once more across the prairie.
            After a fast 26 miles over the flat, flat expanse of Western Missouri, we reached Golden City and feasted on fried
            catfish and blueberry pie. Then it was another 33 houseless miles until we reached Pittsburg.
            We amused ourselves with the many signs for “Pittsburg” without the h, and for the PSU (Pittsburg State University)
            Gorillas. We stopped for a successful tuneup at the local bike shop, and finished the day with a gluttonous dinner at a
            Chinese buffet before settling in for a needed snooze at the Super8.

            We spent a lazy morning at the Super8 enjoying their continental breakfast and blogging. We finally set out around 11,
            and quickly got sidetracked with taking pictures at a “Welcome to Pittsburg” sign.
            When we finally hit the road again, we tried to take a shortcut to get back on-route, which seemed pretty foolproof
            since all the roads in Kansas are on a grid. It quickly became apparent that this was a terrible idea, as the road
            turned into rough gravel that threatened to damage our tires.
            At this point we should have turned around, but we spent the next hour convinced that the remaining distance of gravel
            in front of us was less than what we’d left behind, so we walked our bikes in the blazing sun to try to minimize the
            tire damage. This led to the trifecta of us losing biking time, damaging our cleats so that it was difficult to
            impossible to clip into the our pedals, and becoming very hot, tired and frustrated. Thus the day was dubbed “the worst
            day ever.”
            On the bright side, the wind and terrain were still very favorable, so once we had replenished morale with some ice
            cream, we made good time the rest of the day (except one missed turn that led to a 4 mile detour, but after the gravel
            “shortcut,” this was small potatoes). A stop in Chanute failed to turn up a bike shop that could sell us new cleats, but
            at least we got a high quality dinner at subway.
            With the sun beginning to set, we pushed through the last hour of the day at about 17 mph, reaching Benedict.
            Benedict provided a final trial for the day, with still sweltering temperatures and hordes of mosquitoes tormenting us
            as we searched for the cyclist camping listed on the map. After failing to find the church, we followed the map’s
            listing of “camping at store/church” and pitched our tents outside the general store. We spent a restless night sweating
            in our tents and contemplating a 4 am wake up to try and reach a distant bike shop to get cleats before it closed for
            the weekend.

        Mere hours after we had fallen asleep, our 4 am alarm woke us up. Since it was still dark, and even more so because we
        were extremely sleepy, we made the decision to sleep in all the way to 6, forgoing our hopes of making it to the bike
        shop.
        As we were breaking camp, a beaten up school bus pulled up, and we caught our first sight of pastor Joe Wortham. As Matt
        later described it, if even a tenth of the things Joe told us were true, he is the most interesting person we’ve ever
        met.
        Joe started by rubbing salt in our wounds by telling us that had we called or otherwise found the church, we would have
        slept inside away from the heat and bugs, and gotten dinner. As it was, he was not going to let us out of Benedict
        without showing some hospitality. As the owner of the town store, he gave us free Gatorade and offered us any snacks we
        wanted. He then took us to his home and made us a wonderful breakfast of biscuits, bacon and fresh eggs. As he cooked he
        regaled us with tales of his time in the army, outdoorsman tips, biblical law, and the impending solar flare that would
        knock out all electricity in America for ten months.
        We were thrilled with his hospitality, and even more so with his stories. We learned Indian secrets on how to build a
        smokeless fire, how he had technically died 5 times, and how God had saved him from the days when he had been wanted in
        48 states for running “Mexican brown.” In short it was an unforgettable morning, and we left his home at 9 with DVDs on
        the lost books of the bible and hours worth of stories.
        Though we left late, we once again found that we could bike very quickly in the absence of hills. After some pleasant
        miles through the endless wheat and corn fields, we were increasingly alarmed to see an ominous thunderstorm forming on
        the horizon. As it came closer, we were half convinced that it was a tornado, so the ride for our lives was on. We sped
        through turbulent wind and pelting rain as fast as we could go, finally emerging in a calm patch beneath a hole in the
        clouds. We (probably incorrectly) took this to be “the eye of the storm,” but whatever it was,we all agreed the sun
        streaming down through the billowing clouds was one of the most beautiful things we’d ever seen.
        Within minutes, the storm passed over us, and took the opportunity to eat, dry off, and talk to some motorcyclists at
        the next gas station. As we ate our new favorite vegetable, canned sweet peas, and discussed the adventures of the day,
        the previous day’s misery was already feeling like a distant memory.
        We got one final dose of excitement as we biked the final stretch towards Newton. Charlie was attempting to film a large
        flock of turkey vultures circling overhead, and as he craned upwards to get a better shot, he inadvertently veered and
        clipped Matt’s wheel. Charlie’s subsequent crash was very dramatic and involved a barrel roll, but he was uninjured.
        Luckily, it was also caught on tape, so soon you will be able to join Peter and Matt in laughing at him.
        We finally arrived in Newton and found our way to the fire station to stay the night. We met a very friendly family that
        was touring the country, and briefly saw two twentysomething guys, one of whom was riding a bike made of bamboo. We
        wished we could have socialized more, but after our big day, we were soon fast asleep.

            After the previous day’s excitement, we had an extremely lazy morning, sleeping in and dawdling around the fire station
            until 11. As we rode out, we got some strange looks from the firemen, who must have thought we were the worst cyclists
            ever compared to the typical 6 am risers.
            
            Once again, the conditions were very favorable and we zoomed past farm fields, and increasingly cow pastures, on our way
            to Larned. We had a good laugh when a local chatting with us at a gas station described a slight upcoming tilt in the
            land as a “big hill.”
            
            After a pleasant initial 40 miles, we hit a long 58 mile stretch with no towns or other resources. We stocked up on
            water and candy and set out at a leisurely pace (still probably ~14 mph with the lack of wind). The route took us
            through Quivera wildlife preserve, which almost looked like African savanna, except instead of herds of antelopes and
            lion prides there were a few deer and a lot of oil rigs. We stopped to get a few pictures, and set out again with
            increased urgency as we realized we still had 38 miles to go to Larned and 2.5 hours of daylight at most.
            
            After some uptempo riding, we put in a final power hour as the sun set over some dusty ranches and fields. We were
            particularly proud of averaging about 24 mph over a 5 mile stretch, and 20 mph over the final 20 miles to Larned, though
            it just about killed Charlie. As we rode, we were treated to some aerial acrobatics by a plane spraying the fields,
            which almost was enough to distract us from the blistering pace.
            
            Upon reaching Larned, we were treated to free soda and candy at the Larned movie theater, and talked with the volunteers
            running the theater, who apologized for the cow smell that pervades the town. After the hard ride, this was a welcome
            treat and we lingered until it was really starting to get dark.
            
            Due to the threat of thunderstorms, we stayed at a motel. There we encountered members of the second Adventure Cycling
            group (having passed the first group in Kentucky). We talked for a bit with Chris, who lives near Perth, in Western
            Australia. Chris noted that of all the cyclists, he was the most at home in the hot, dusty weather of western Kansas.
            
            As we went to sleep, we were vindicated in our choice of motelling by the loud crashes of thunder outside.

            We got up around 7:30 after many of the adventure cyclists had already left, and made our way to the inn’s continental
            breakfast. As we did our best to get our money’s worth out of the cereal, toast, and juice, we encountered the same two
            cyclists who we had very briefly met at the Newton fire station and who had the bamboo bike. Chris (not Australian
            Chris) and Matt (not our Matt) are both in their mid twenties and in the process of biking from New York to their
            hometown of Los Angeles. They were very friendly, and Chris had grown a beard during the trip that was bigger and more
            luscious than Charlie, Matt, and Peter’s put together, not that that’s saying much.
            
            After setting out around 9, we soon began passing adventure cyclists. During a 19 mile stretch with strong headwinds, we
            began a tight drafting line with Peter at the front valiantly fighting the gusts. As our line passed Chris (the
            Australian we met the previous day), he took the opportunity to tag along at the back, commenting that he “owed us a
            six-pack” for our wind-breaking services.
            
            Once we had turned off of the road going into the wind, we stopped at a diner in the tiny town of Rush Center to get
            some lunch. The diner was so small it had no menu (the waitress informed us that they served hamburgers, grilled cheese,
            and fries) and apparently only one waitress. Nonetheless it was bustling with a mixture of locals and cyclists. We saw
            Los Angeles Matt and Chris once again, and Australian Chris sat with us for a bit before heading out. He described his
            first impression of America as feeling as if it was a TV show come to life, since he watches so much American TV.
            
            After lunch, the ride settled into a steady rhythm. We would ride through 20 to 30 miles of endless wheat fields and cow
            pastures with hardly a person to be seen, before pulling into small but clean and apparently prosperous towns rising
            suddenly out of the plains. The grain silos and water towers of the towns were usually tantalizingly visible at least
            7-8 miles before we actually reached the town, making those miles seem to drag on forever.
            
            For once we decided to end the day relatively early, stopping in Dighton around 4:30. We set up camp in the local park,
            and took to opportunity to do some pushups and pullups on the jungle gym in attempt to fight the ever-progressing
            atrophy of all muscles not involved in pedaling. We followed this up with a typical gas station dinner.
            
            Returning to the park after dinner, we were pleased to discover Matt and Chris had arrived and were staying in the same
            park. They were in the process of putting our dinner to shame with a camp stove-cooked stew of ramen noodles,
            hard-boiled eggs, and sardines. As they cooked, we talked with them and were treated to tales from some very interesting
            lives.
            
            Los Angeles Matt is a freelance journalist for Vice, and told us stories about his time spending a year living in
            Jordan, doing stories on drone strikes and social issues in the middle east from time to time. He said he was going to
            enter grad school after he got back to LA, and figure things out from there. He was also the master chef behind the
            ramen stew.
            
            Los Angeles Chris had spent the previous year and a half teaching English in Brazil. He was planning on studying to
            become a carpenter when he returned to LA, and was also the proud owner the magnificent beard we admired at breakfast.
            
            After talking into the night, we retired to our tents, happy to have met some friends going the same way as us (for the
            time being).

            We slept all the way in to 8, so by the time we got up, Los Angeles Matt and Chris had already departed to beat the
            predicted afternoon thunderstorms. We almost left town by 9:30, but at the gas station we met some of the Adventure
            Cycling group, so we talked with them for a while. One retired engineer went into great depth on the engineering job
            market for the benefit of our group’s engineers. Upon hearing that Charlie was a biology major, he expressed concern for
            his job prospects, but reminded him that there were bioengineers too.
            
            Talking with the Adventure cyclists pushed back our departure to almost 11, at which point we were getting concerned
            about making it to Sheridan Lake before the thunderstorms hit.
            
            The ride itself was mostly uneventful, but the landscape had a kind of desolate beauty. We rode for hours through the
            truly empty prairie on roads that seemed to stretch into infinity. It was surreal to look around and see nothing but
            grass, road, and sky. We laughed when we saw the sign welcoming us to “colorful Colorado,” as the sign itself was
            entirely brown, as was the entire landscape except for the grayish sky.
            
            Our strange but peaceful ride was interrupted just 5 miles from Sheridan Lake when the thunderstorms finally rolled in.
            Suddenly, we found ourselves buffeted by winds and pelted with hail the size of gobstoppers. The hail really hurt, so we
            took shelter behind a conveniently placed building. After only 5 minutes or so, the storm moved on, and we hustled the
            last few miles hoping to avoid any more hail encounters.
            
            Upon reaching Sheridan Lake, we found a very modest settlement in the otherwise empty prairie, but the pastor of the
            local church and his family welcomed us graciously into the church, where they host cyclists. Los Angeles Matt and Chris
            were already there, as were two other twentysomething cyclists, Tim and Merceda, who were also headed west.
            
            We all had a fun night eating, talking, and enjoying the indoors while the thunderstorm raged outside. Everyone made fun
            of Charlie when he burned popcorn and almost set off the smoke detector in one of his weaker outings as a chef.
            
            While we ate, Matt and Peter looked through the maps and determined that if we reached Pueblo the next day, we only
            needed to average 79 miles a day not including three rest days and we would reach San Francisco by July 13. With this
            heartening news, we went to sleep ready for a big 140 mile push to Pueblo in the morning.

            We bid farewell to our new cyclist friends in the morning as we readied for the planned 140 mile push to Pueblo.
            No sooner had we left the church then we were confronted with stiff 20 mph winds from the southwest. We were determined
            to reach our goal, however, so we fell into drafting formation and began the long slog towards Pueblo.
            In addition to being windy, we found eastern Colorado to be extremely dry. Tumbleweeds bounced across our path and
            rather than grass, the land was covered in sagebrush, cacti, and dust. We found ourselves draining our water at an
            alarming rate to stave off dehydration, and the gritty truck stops that dotted the road every 30 miles or so were much
            needed.
            At one such truck stop, a van pulled up and the driver asked Peter (who is now very tan) if he spoke Spanish. He does
            not, but we all gathered around nonetheless to see if we could help. Upon closer inspection, the van was completely full
            of Hispanic people, one of whom asked in broken English which way Kansas City was.
            We felt bad for them, since they were currently headed west, while Kansas City was somewhere 500 miles east. Charlie
            suggested they turn around and drive “a long way” until they saw signs for Kansas City. Seeing the looks of confusion,
            he added “for hundreds of miles.” The English speaker of the group clarified “a hundred miles that way?”, and we were
            forced to insist “no, like 500 miles.” With a weary look, the driver wheeled about and the wayward van drove away in the
            general direction of Kansas City.
            Further down the road, we spied some sort of large animal on top of a nearby hill. Charlie had just enough time to see
            that it was an exotic pronghorn antelope before master naturalist Matt decided to moo at the pronghorn, scaring it away.
            Pulling into Ordway, thirsty and tired, we sat down to our mid-afternoon meal. As we ate, locals chatted with us about
            our trip and informed us that the remaining 50 miles to Pueblo were currently experiencing 60 mph winds and a giant
            smoke cloud from a wildfire. This was more than enough of an excuse for us, and we decided to call it a day.
            We checked in to the once-nice Ordway Hotel, and spent most of the evening trying to wrangle the ancient hotel computer
            into accessing email. Out of the window, a cloud of wildfire smoke obscured the sun until it appeared blood-red,
            affirming our decision not to press on (quote from Matt: “dude, the moon is blood-red!”). We headed to bed early, eager
            to reach Pueblo in the morning before the winds picked up.

    We left Ordway at 7 hoping to beat the winds. With a relatively moderate 10 mph headwind, we cruised the remaining miles
    to Pueblo past stinky feedlots and scenic desert. We had another wildlife sighting when a red fox darted across the
    road, but the desert was otherwise deserted.
    Arriving in Pueblo, we checked into the Santa Fe Inn, and founding ourselves sharing the inn with a brigade of
    participants in a large antique car show. This left the parking lot filled with a disconcerting number of brightly
    colored 1950s hot rods.
    Once we had settled in, generous friends (and Charlie’s middle school Sunday school teacher) Larry and Kathy Dansky
    picked us up for an afternoon in better-than-Pueblo Colorado Springs. They treated us to a quality lunch at Margarita’s,
    before continuing on to the US Olympic training center in Colorado Springs.
    The Olympic training center began our tour with an inspirational Olympics montage, which made all of us wish we had
    started intensively training for a sport at a younger age. We then toured the training facilities, which were
    surprisingly modest. The basketball gym was standard, and the gymnastics equipment was stuffed into a basketball court’s
    area, though they did have cameras for instant replay. As the tour wrapped up, we bumped into one of the athletes, skier
    Peyton. She chatted with our group for a bit, and has therefore vaulted up Charlie’s power rankings to become his
    favorite Olympian for 2014
    After our wonderful afternoon with the Dansky’s, we settled in for the remainder of our rest day at the Santa Fe Inn. We
    attempted to rent a movie, but a cashier at the nearby convenience store informed us that the video store we were
    looking for was actually an “XXX store.” We ultimately settled for a rousing viewing of the Shawshank Redemption on TV
    before drifting off to sleep, slightly less sore than usual.

We slept in until just before the continental breakfast ended at 9, and then returned to bed for maximum rest and
recovery. At 10, Matt got up and generously agreed to journey to the bike shop we had called previously to pick up our
new cleats. This simple task would seemingly only take a half hour to an hour at most.
It took two hours. Matt’s odyssey began with the antique car parade blocking his path and forcing him to reroute through
the side roads and back alleys of Pueblo. His iPhone next gave him an incorrect address, leading to 30 minutes of
fruitless searching for the store in a random shopping center. After finally locating the store and getting the cleats,
Matt drowned his sorrows in a large DQ blizzard (DQ count: 8?), and returned to Charlie and Peter around noon.
After the delayed success of the Matt expedition, we set about making arrangements to visit Great Sand Dunes National
Park, a 2-3 hour drive away. Our plan was to rent a car to drive down, but we were foiled repeatedly by the Byzantine
policies of the rental companies. One wouldn’t rent to 21 year olds, one required a credit card (we only had debit), and
finally one told us they would call when they had a car available. After waiting hours to find our only rental
opportunity was to rent a minivan for 3 days, we called it quits and whiled away the rest of the day eating at a Mexican
restaurant with a live mariachi band and watching Arrested Development. It was awesome.

We got an early start to try and jump start our mileage after a lazy couple days in Pueblo. At the continental
breakfast, we saw our old friends Tim and Mercedas, with whom we commiserated about the upcoming climb over the
mountain.
Once we had checked out, we began the trek across the desert to the looming Rockies. Smoke from distant wildfires left
the air hazy, so we used bandanas and T-shirts to cover our mouths for partial relief.
On the way up to the mountain, we found several of the shops marked on the map closed or abandoned, but we were able to
conserve our water and survive.
The mountain itself, though over 9000 feet high, was traversed by well-paved roads that ascended very gradually. We had
to take a couple stops to catch our breath at the altitude, but found the climb otherwise relatively easy, if long. We
even encountered a very friendly dog at one such stop outside a ranch, which lifted everyone’s morale.
After cresting the pass, we cruised downhill through more smoke before reaching the town of Ridgeway. As we ate at the
local diner, the owner ribbed us about how cute the cook, coincidentally her daughter, was. Despite the owner’s
protestations that we should stay in Ridgeway for a while (just a week or two!), we pressed on down the mountain.
As we rode, the setting sun was shining through the remaining smoke over an already spectacular landscape of cliffs and
peaks. The beauty was breathtaking, and we spent the descent alternately whooping with excitement and checking to make
sure the GoPro was filming.
Emerging on the Arkansas River, we saw a sign for whitewater rafting. We all immediately agreed that this was a great
idea, so we sought lodging in nearby Cotopaxi so we could catch the morning trip.
The minister of Cotopaxi Church welcomed us inside when we knocked, and set us up in the vacation bible school room. We
spent a great night feasting on leftover bible school cookies and getting excited for the morning. The Rockies are even
more awesome than Arrested Development.

The morning began as planned with a whitewater rafting trip. Our rafting guide, Taylor, turned out to be a newly
graduated Penn State alum, so we had fun playing the “do you know *insert first name*” game.
Rafting proved to be just as fun as anticipated, with plenty of spinning and splashing. Matt and Peter “rode the bull”
by sitting on the bow over the final rapids, and ended the ride by being pushed and pulled, respectively, into the
river.
With rafting behind us, we were forced to get back in the saddle. Fortunately, the Rockies continued to provide
incredible scenery. Matt and Charlie could not resist frolicking in an irrigation sprinkler on a particularly
magnificent farm field beneath white-capped mountains. The memory was not even spoiled by the later appearance of the
farmer who owned the field, telling us that we were trespassing, and that we better not be messing with his sprinkler.
Eventually, our route turned way from the scenic Arkansas and we began our slow ascent towards Monarch Pass, part of the
Continental Divide, and the highest point if our route at 11,312 feet. The altitude, compounded by wildfire smog, once
again forced us to bike slowly. As dusk drew close, we gave up on ascending the pass that day and decided to stay in the
“town” of Garfield at 10,000 feet.
Upon reaching Garfield, we were disappointed to find that it consisted of a defunct ski lodge and a snowmobile rental
store that was closed. Hoping to get out of the smoke, we double-checked the lodge and found a door open.
Inside, we found a formerly nice lodge straight out of The Shining. The electricity, TVs and plumbing still worked, but
most of the rooms were open and in disarray, and we could not find a single person inside, though we weren’t exactly
sure we wanted to.
On the top floor, we found a room with a piano and some torn-up cushions. On the piano was a creepy painted mask, and a
fairly large knife. At this point, we were certain that we had walked into the setting of a horror movie, and we got the
hell out.
We biked away as quickly as we could, and managed to pitch our tents a bit away from the road before dark. We then spent
a jittery night dreaming of deranged alpine knife murderers.

We got up early to get away from Garfield as quickly as possible. We climbed the frigid last thousand feet of elevation
to Monarch Pass, where we found more unbelievable views, and the Monarch Pass store/restaurant, which was miraculously
open.
With an overpriced but welcome breakfast of nachos and hot chocolate in our bellies, we began our hard-earned descent.
The road swooped downwards at 6% grade for over nine miles, so we flew down the mountain. Reaching the next small town,
we stopped for more food at a convenience store. There we met Megan Fish and her young daughter, Neva (blog:
Nevatravelwithaninfant).
We were extremely impressed with Megan, who was in the midst of a tour through the Rockies from her home in Texas, all
with over 125 ponds of gear, including Neva. She was climbing Monarch Pass with all this, making us feel like wusses for
complaining about our climb. Megan chatted with us for a while, bestowing wisdom born of many bike tours (her favorite
tour: pacific coast trail). We exchanged blog information, and Megan resumed her grueling climb, while we resumed our
effortless descent properly humbled.
The mountain eventually spit us out in Gunnison, a prosperous tourist/college town bigger than most we had been through.
We had a delicious (and vegetarian-friendly for once!) Indian/Nepalese lunch at the Sherpa Cafe, and went on to
investigate the nearby playground, which had the biggest slide any of us had ever seen. After Matt and Peter had tested
the slide, we resumed our ride into the Cimmaron national recreation area.
The Cimmaron area encompasses the Gunnison river and a lake, with a striking backdrop of cliffs. Unfortunately, it also
encompasses some fierce headwinds in the afternoon, which severely impaired our enjoyment of the scenery.
After a hard afternoon of biking, we pulled into a bar/store in the 20 person town of Sapinero. Once we had bought our
food, we moved into the bar area to watch the Stanley Cup with the bar owner.
After this pleasant interlude, we resumed our ride, aiming to get to the next campsite before dark. We barely made our
goal, arriving at the creek-side campground at dusk. On the bright side, there were shower facilities and electricity,
but to our dismay, the laundry machine was broken and space to pitch our tents cost as much as a motel. We sucked it up,
showered, and fell asleep to the gurgling of the creek.

We awoke to find the campground store inexplicably closed, so we decided to just bike 4 miles down the road to Cimmarron
for food. This led to brief panic when we found the Cimmarron motel and gas station both run down and abandoned, leading
us to believe we would have to go another 15 miles without any extra water or food. Fortunately, the rest of tiny
Cimmarron was just around the corner, and we stocked up on overpriced food and water.
Continuing on our way, we saw the sign for the turn-off to Black Canyon National Park. We debated about whether to go,
as we didn’t know how far it was, and we were a bit behind schedule. However, a shopkeeper at the intersection informed
us that it was only 6 miles, so we were off. What was not mentioned was that the 6 miles was straight uphill.
After a grueling unanticipated to climb, we arrived at the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. The canyon itself
was incredible, dropping almost straight down for a thousand feet (it’s called the black canyon because sunlight rarely
reaches the bottom). Though tired, we deemed the climb with it and stopped for some pictures.
While at the black canyon, we had the honor of meeting a woman named Tracey and her friends. Her friends all
enthusiastically informed us that they too had biked across the country a few years ago. One of the friends (whose name
we didn’t get) went on to describe her excitement for her upcoming Ironman. Not only that, but Tracey was recently
sponsored by a mountain bike company as the oldest female competitor in a multi week bike race through the mountains
from Canada to Mexico. As if meeting Megan had not been enough, after our meeting with Tracey and co., we were
thoroughly re-humbled.
Once we had left the Black Canyon, we headed towards Montrose, hoping to salvage some mileage after our side-trip. We
had lunch at a Mexican restaurant, where we took full advantage of the free refills of chips and salsa.
After Montrose, the route turned south towards more mountains. Peter punctured a tire and popped two inner tubes, which
was an annoyance for him, but led to welcome food for Charlie and Matt while Peter fixed his bike.
In Ridgeway, we ate at Subway, where the gabby employee gave us his standup comedy routine (he unironically called
himself a “literal smartass” for taking everything we said literally).
After dinner, we got lodging at a combination hostel/restaurant. The bathroom for the hostel actually opened into the
restaurant area, which led to some weird looks from the restaurant patrons when we emerged from the shower to return to
our rooms. The day ended a bit low on mileage, but well-spent nonetheless.

    Our breakfast at the Ridgeway Cafe was surprisingly expensive, but at least we started the day with hearty servings of
    omelets and hashbrowns. We then steeled ourselves for a day of tough hill climbing.
    The first hill of the day was relatively short, but gave us some impressive views of the looming San Juan mountains.
    Descending the hill, we ran into Connor and Matt, 20 year-olds biking from San Francisco to their homes in New Jersey.
    We had a good laugh when we realized they had the exact same jerseys as Charlie and our Matt, leading to an excellent
    photo-op.
    Continuing on our route, we began our ascent through the San Juans. The scenery was once again remarkable, with dramatic
    cliffs, sweeping valleys, and a ring of sheer peaks around it all. The climb itself went along a former railroad, so it
    was pretty gradual to boot. Overall, it was about the most pleasant way you could hope to bike to over 10,000 feet.
    An undisclosed amount of time later, we arrived in an undisclosed town looking for a place to camp. As we were stopped
    at a gas station for food, a local approached us and, surmising our need for a campsite, offered to direct us to a
    nearby hot spring where we could camp, provided we kept the location secret (he didn’t want it swarmed with outsiders).
    We jumped at the offer, and before long we were trekking to the promised hot spring.
    The hot spring was a fairly small bubbling pool of water in a raised basin of rock, but someone had piped the water a
    short distance into a hot tub-like construction near the river. We made camp and wasted no time in getting into the tub,
    instantly relaxing our sore muscles. We had the hot spring to ourselves for a good 20 minutes before a local showed up
    and joined us.
    The local was named Mike, who we quickly discovered had lived an interesting life in the area as a “mountain athlete”
    and carpenter. Mike was formerly a serious ultimate Frisbee player who had gotten into mountain running and backcountry
    skiing. He nonchalantly described his multiple top ten finishes in 100 mile trail races in the mountains, declaring the
    Leadville 100 miler “anticlimactic” and “overhyped” (the Hardrock 100 miler, with untold elevation gain and a 48 hour
    cutoff, was apparently more worthwhile). He informed us that his running days were over due to injury, but that he would
    never give up backcountry skiing, despite the high risk of avalanche, which had killed one ex-girlfriend and buried
    another.
    Having met yet another extreme Colorado athlete, we retired to our tents. We fell asleep under the stars to the gurgling
    if the stream and the chatter of other visitors to the hot spring.

We got up early enough for Matt and Peter to take another dip in the hot spring before rolling out. We made good time
down the mountain and stopped in Dolores long enough to eat some overpriced pizza.
As we left Dolores and the San Juans, the landscape rapidly changed from alpine forest to dry scrubland. We passed a
iridescent blue lake, but other than that the landscape was mostly brown and boring. The sign at the Utah state border
had a surprisingly picturesque backdrop of mountains and irrigated farms, but the farms soon gave way again to desert.
Arriving in Monticello, we found a relatively cheap motel, where the enthusiastic woman at the desk advised us on all
the national parks we should see, and that we should come back for another visit to see those we missed.
We went to a local restaurant, were a patron discovered to his displeasure that Monticello is a Mormon town, and as such
has no alcohol. Afterwards, we returned to the hotel, where Matt and Charlie indulged in a surprisingly enjoyable
viewing of Pitch Perfect (the movie about the struggles of a college a cappella group) before a late bedtime.

Our late night led to a late start in the morning, which was unfortunate because we had a 90 mile day planned, and the
temperature was quickly rising. Regardless, we easily made the short jaunt to Blanding, the last outpost of civilization
before a 78 mile stretch of desert preceding Lake Powell. We stocked up on food and water for the journey ahead at the
Family Dollar. Charlie also picked up some purple flip flops to replace his list shoes, for which he was mocked by Matt
and Peter, who apparently adhere very rigorously to gender norms for flip flop color.
Finally underway, the ride to Lake Powell started well, with a descent into the desert surrounded by some dramatic red
cliffs and canyons. Alas, this descent was immediately followed by a steep climb in the 110+ degree heat, during which
we drank the majority of our water.
The remaining 50 or so miles thus became a race against our dwindling water supplies. We continued to ride past buttes,
cliffs and canyons that looked straight out of a Wile E Coyote cartoon, but we increased noticed only our thirstiness.
Our predicament was resolved with around 20 miles to go when a passing van offered us water (to be fair, we probably
could have flagged down a driver for water much sooner, but we were too stubborn). The van was actually a support
vehicle for another rider, and was emblazoned with a large Mercy Riders logo surrounded by clouds, making it feel almost
like divine intervention. They were headed to DC to raise awareness about housing, but we were extremely grateful that
they also made it their mission to look out for us on the desolate road to Lake Powell.
We arrived at Lake Powell to find the lake itself dried up and the only grocery store closed for the day. Fortunately,
there was a spigot for water, which we drank greedily. We also scrounged up our change and indulged in ice cold sodas
from the Pepsi machine, which tasted heavenly after the long, hot ride.
Rather than bike more to camp by the dry lakebed, we biked over to the small cluster of houses that compose the town of
Hite. A local directed us to the RV area in the middle of town, where we pitched camp and reveled in the freely
available drinking water for a bit. We were unable to fall asleep for at least an hour after dark due to the lingering
heat, but as consolation we were treated to a brilliant night sky.

We woke up sweating as soon as the sun peeked over the horizon. Though the heat was still oppressive, it was
exponentially more bearable with plentiful water. We stopped by the grocery store as soon as it opened and bought
snacks, Gatorade for the road ahead, and an ice cream bar or three. Thus fortified for our ride through the heat, we
took the additional step of soaking ourselves with water from the spigot, for maximum dehydration protection.
Feeling much more prepared than the day before, we struck out across the desert towards Hanksville, 40 miles away. Our
soaked clothes were effective for about 3 miles before all the water evaporated, but we were carrying enough water this
time to continue to stave off the heat. We biked across the Colorado river, and then through more cliffs and canyons
before a long stretch across barren, sandy desert.
Finally reaching Hanksville, we eagerly biked towards a restaurant whose sign advertised milkshakes. Some lunch and a
glorious milkshake later, we felt ready to face the heat again.
Just as we were leaving the parking lot, we were approached by two women, Kristin and Michelle. They explained that they
were also bikers, and were very interested in our trip. Upon hearing we were going cross country, they insisted on
giving us some if their food, which ended up being an eclectic mix of Pringles, carrots, bread, and peanuts. Pleased
with our windfall, we thanked them and set out again for the final leg before Capitol Reef National Park.
Riding along the trickles of water that pass as rivers in southern Utah, we entered the fairly ordinary canyon where
Capitol Reef is located. Slowly, signs of what made the area special enough to be a national park appeared, in the form
of small waterfalls and some Native American petroglyphs. The greenery surrounding the river also changed, from generic
bushes and cottonwoods to the irrigated farms and orchards of Fruita, the old Mormon settlement.
Surrounded by scenery strangely reminiscent of a Pennsylvania farm bordered by sheer, red canyon walls, we finally
reached the park campground as the sun was setting. We pitched our tents, and had a brief chat with some Swiss and
German tourists who were also biking through the area. They spoke enough English and Charlie enough German for a basic
conversation, but after a while the talk ran out of steam and we left them to their beers and returned to our tents for
the night.

We arose feeling much cooler and more refreshed than the day before. This was fortunate, since the challenge du jour was
scaling Boulder mountain, a forested 9500 foot peak that would not have been out of place in the Rockies.
The road out of Capitol Reef was slightly uphill and took us through more steep canyons and arid brush land. As we got
further out of the park, the climb got steeper and the sagebrush gave way to pine trees. Before long, we found ourselves
battling up 14% grade slopes, sustained by the Nicki Manaj blasting from Matt’s speaker.
Reaching the summit, we were rewarded with a dramatic view down the forested slopes towards the rocky canyonlands
beyond. After pictures and a pick-me-up of skittles, we resumed our ride back down the other side of the the mountain.
The descent was fairly uneventful until less than a mile from the town of Boulder, when Charlie’s rear rack became
detached from his frame (though it was still attached at the axle), causing to flip back onto his wheel. An accident was
averted by Charlie’s poise and skillful riding, and we managed to jerry-rig the rack back onto the bike with Peter’s
bungee cords and some zip ties. Cautiously optimistic, we rolled the remaining distance to Boulder for some expensive,
tourist-priced burgers.
Post-Boulder, we began the highly recommended ride through Grand Staircase National Monument towards Escalante. The road
took us along a ridge with steep drop offs on the shoulders on either side, giving a spectacular view of the red rock
canyons that surrounded us far below. Zooming down the steep grade, we soaked in the surreal scenery as we descended
into one of the canyons, with bright red rock contrasting against green foliage and the blue ribbon of river.
Alas, we had to pay for our joy ride down with an equally steep ascent back out of the canyon. As consolation, the views
remained incredible, and we stopped periodically to document both the landscape and our long climb. At the top, we met a
nice German couple (the area is packed with German tourists for some reason), who took our picture and chatted with us
about our trip.
Emerging from the hills, we pulled into Escalante, with time to spare for once. We feasted on milkshakes, burgers, and
fries before retiring to a hotel for badly needed showers and beds.

We left Escalante excited for even more fantastic scenery at nearby Bryce Canyon National Park. The ride there was
fairly uneventful, with some easy hills and generic sagebrush and pine tree based surroundings. We stopped in Tropic for
food, where Peter was excited to discover an old piano available for public use outside of the town grocery store. After
a meal, ice cream (naturally), chatting with locals, and some piano, we set off once more for Bryce Canyon.

Approaching the canyon, we were tantalized with views of some of the spectacular red and white rock cliffs and hoodoos
that make the area famous. We soon lost much of our initial enthusiasm, however, when we were forced up a fairly steep
1500 foot climb into town. Fortunately, we were able to recuperate from the climb while waiting for the extremely
welcome bus running from Bryce Canyon City to the park itself.

The bus took us to several viewpoints, where we took in the otherworldly canyon. The lookouts sat over steep drops down
to the canyon floor about a thousand feet below. Tall red and white hoodoos studded the canyon, while splashes of green
trees accentuated the colorful landscape. We wished we had time to hike the trails winding between the spires of rock
below, but we settled for taking a lot of pictures and soaking in the view.

With another national park under our belts, we pressed on to try and make it a few more miles before dark. We were
rewarded with a bike trail through more beautiful red rock cliffs and a few more hoodoos. To top off the day, we stopped
at an RV/camping area with the holy trinity of showers, laundry, and wifi. Matt managed to start the short-lived first
fire of the trip, which burned out almost immediately due to it’s fuel consisting entirely of pine cones. For once,
there weren’t even mosquitos, so we finished up the day by relaxing under a brilliant sunset and the subsequent starry
sky.

Once again, we prepared for a big day with the second to last major mountain of the trip. We fortified ourselves with
some slushees at a country store before beginning the long 4,000 foot climb. The going was tough at times, with long,
steep slopes and an unfortunate lack of bathrooms, but we pushed on until the visitor center for Cedar Breaks National
Monument at the 10,000+ foot peak.

Cedar Breaks provided yet another spectacular vista, with an entire side of the mountain eroded away to reveal red rock
walls and hoodoos reminiscent of Bryce Canyon. While enjoying one of the overlooks, we also chatted with one of the park
rangers, an older man who revealed that he had cycled from Germany to Greece and then in Egypt back in the 60s. He was
impressed with our trip, but we found his fascinating and began hashing out grand plans for more bike tours through
Europe and beyond after this trip.

After we had taken in Cedar Breaks and recovered from the climb, we hopped back on our bikes for a fast and furious
descent down the mountain towards Cedar City. The road was steep and windy at times, so we practiced our best Tour de
France cornering techniques and raced through the dramatic cliffs and forests. Flying around another bright red rock
formation, we found ourselves suddenly in Cedar City, a teeming metropolis of 28,000.

In the city, we checked into the cheap Super 7 Motel (apparently a 1/8 cheaper relative of Super 8) and had a hearty
dinner of calzones at the local pizza shop. Legs tired and bellies full, we settled in to the luxurious hotel beds for a
sound night’s sleep.

We slept in a bit and strolled out of the motel around 9 to drop Charlie’s bike by the bike shop. Fortunately, they had
the parts to replace the bungee cord holding his rear rack on with real metal attachments.

While the bike was being fixed, we stopped by the nearby cafe for some good breakfast omelettes. As we were eating, we
all of a sudden saw our old friends (California) Matt and Chris walk into the cafe. We were excited to see them if a bit
peeved that they had managed to catch us. As we caught up with them, they invited us to spend the next day, July 4th,
with them celebrating in nearby Milford. Content with a good excuse to not bike, we agreed and headed out to pick up our
bikes for the relatively short 56 mile jaunt to MIlford.

The ride was slightly uphill through an utterly deserted landscape of sagebrush and roadside litter. We made short work
of the minor hill in our way due to Charlie’s valiant pulling through the headwind, and soon found ourselves approaching
the lone town of Minersville 11 miles outside of Milford.

The ride quickly gained some excitement when we rode past a small wildfire on a hill a couple miles from the road. We
could see some of the flames and a huge smoke cloud, but fortunately the fire was downwind from us, and we could see
helicopters circling the fire, presumably working to get it under control.

Once in Minersville, we took an extended ice cream and snack break to beat the heat. The friendly shop owner microwaved
us burritos and commented that we had a long ride to San Francisco, though to us it was starting to feel within reach.

With dusk approaching, we finally mustered to motivation to leave the convenience store and push through the last few
miles to Milford. Arriving in town, we got set up in the Milford Affordable Motel, which was precisely as affordable and
as run-down as the name would suggest.

Chris and Matt straggled into town a while later, and together we had dinner at the local Mexican restaurant, which
kindly stayed open late to provide us with Mexican cokes (made with sugar instead of corn syrup) and burritos made with
a motley assortment of leftovers.

After a fun evening of eating and catching up, we retired to our motel room, excited for the small town July 4th
festivities that awaited us in the morning.

We rolled out of bed relaxed and ready for our day off. We made our way to main street for the town parade, which seemed
to have drawn most of the town population of 1400. Firetrucks and ambulances rode past with volunteers throwing candy to
excited little kids and Matt, while a notable number of townspeople of all ages rode by in rodeo gear on horses.
After taking in the parade and some lunch from Subway, we headed to the town pool, which was free for the afternoon. The
western Utah sun was scorching, so the cool pool was a welcome relief, even if it was swarming with kids, making us feel
a bit out of place. An eclectic mix of children and adults was taking turns doing some impressive flips and dives from
the diving board, so we watched the action while relaxing in a less-crowded corner of the pool.
After whiling away some of the afternoon, we stopped by the playground to do some pull-ups for a bit of upper body
exercise. We wound up spending more time playing on the monkey bars and a merry-go-round like contraption, which led to
a lot of fun and Peter tearing a decent chunk of skin off of his hands.
With the playground hijinks finished, we returned to the pool, where we met Chris, Matt, and even old friend Mercedes,
who had also caught up to us. After yet more hanging out, we retired to our motel room to recharge after a long day of
relaxation.
As evening fell, we made our way to the high school track to watch the fireworks. There we met Chris and Matt, and,
together with the majority of Milford, we celebrated our nation’s independence and enjoyed a relatively impressive
fireworks display.

Our wonderful rest day behind us, we geared up for the 83 mile no-service stretch to Baker, the longest such stretch of
the trip. We filled our bellies with Subway and stocked up heavily with water and food. Feeling well prepared, we set
out into the desert around 9, later than our compatriots, but fairly early for us.
Shortly outside of town, we met a father-son pair of cyclists coming the opposite direction. The greeted us with great
enthusiasm and we exchanged tips for the ride ahead. After taking pictures with us, they departed, leaving us to
reminisce about the heady early days of our own ride and return to the task of finishing it up.
Our maps had informed us that the Great Basin region, which covers most of Nevada, consists of many small mountain
ranges separated by about 20 miles of flat desert. We found exactly that on our route, repeatedly climbing 1-2 thousand
feet before descending back onto plains.
Descending the first such mountain, we encountered our second pronghorn antelope of the trip. Matt redeemed himself by
not scaring this one, and the pronghorn entranced us by racing alongside our bikes through the sagebrush. Long after it
broke away from the road, we were still able to see it, bounding all alone across the vast, empty landscape.
Channeling our own inner pronghorns, we sped efficiently through the plains and powered over mountains, stopping only a
couple of times for food breaks. It was not especially hot or sunny, so our only impediments were the occasional burst
of rain(!) or headwinds. Coming down the last mountain before Baker, we began surging to over 20 mph, pushing Charlie to
his limit.
We finally stopped at the Utah-Nevada border for pictures, before cruising the last 7 miles into town, done with riding
mid-afternoon for once.
We met Chris, Matt, and Mercedes in one of the town’s two shops, where they were taking advantage of some complementary
drinks. We settled down at a table and recounted our ride to them, at which point they exclaimed indignantly that the
father-son cyclists had apparently not deemed them picture worthy. We had a good laugh and recovered from the ride with
some thick slices of pizza.
Mercedes was prepared and had found us a campsite at the local school. After dinner, we pitched our tents in the
schoolyard and relaxed. A brief windstorm almost blew our tents away, but after that disturbance the night was peaceful.

After the late night we slept in until around ten. For good measure, we spent two hours getting ready and stocking up on
food at the Family Dollar (they have super cheap dried mangos), meaning we didn’t get on the road until noon.
Fortunately, the ride to Eureka was a relatively modest 78 miles, without any particularly large mountains. Shortly
outside of Ely, the loneliest road in America lost any traces of human habitation, and our only company was once again
the traffic that passed by every few minutes.
Our passage across the low mountains and the endless valleys between was fairly smooth at first, but at a food stop in
one of the valleys we saw a rainstorm in the distance that appeared to be approaching. Within minutes it was upon us,
with hail and ferocious winds. We tucked our heads and once agin let our workhorse Peter plow through the wind. Though
our progress was slowed, the wind eventually lessened and we resumed a brisk pace through the open, empty landscape.
About 60 miles down the road, biking through a sagebrush covered valley that looked dishearteningly similar to what we’d
been biking through all day, we were hit with yet more freak Nevada rain. Fortunately, this rain was accompanied by
minimal wind, and we were able to enjoy the beauty if the shimmering water falling over the infinite plain.
Unfortunately, Charlie spent too long filming the natural beauty, and the GoPro ran out of memory, with few prospects
for buying a new memory card any time soon.
Shortly after emerging from the second rainstorm, we encountered Chris and Matt once again. We rode up behind them as
fast as we could, pretending to be cycling pirates of the high highways, but they were in intimidated.
We slowed down from our pirate pace, and cruised with our Californian friends the remaining distance towards Eureka.
Once in town, we stopped at one of the local bar/restaurant/casinos for food. Peter had the misfortune of ordering the
$14 Caesar salad, with consisted of a chicken nugget sized chicken strip, a tomato, and iceberg lettuce with no
dressing. As we ate, we talked to Chris, Matt, and Mercedes (who had gotten in much earlier), and decided that it was a
good night to try camping out in the desert.
Out plans were put on hold by a stop at a gas station to supplement Peter’s subpar dinner. By the time we left, it was
getting dark, so we rode with urgency out of town looking for a good stretch of desert to camp in. Finding much of the
desert fenced off, we settled on an arbitrary patch of sagebrush a short way from the road about a mile away from the
nearest building.

Fumbling in the dark, we walked until we felt far enough from the road and began pitching our tents. The cleared ground
around us looked suspiciously like it was covered in giant anthills, but we trusted our tents to protect us. Camp setup
went without incident for several minutes until California Matt shouted that he saw a rattlesnake. As Matt moved quickly
away, we shined our meager lights and confirmed the presence of a fat rattlesnake right where Matt had been.

Suddenly worried about snakes under every bush, we proceeded cautiously before sighting another rattlesnake just minutes
later. Now we were really freaked out about being bitten, and we practically dove into our tents, hoping we would not
have to get up in the night to pee. We talked nervously for a while, and those with iphones were miraculously able to
get signal and look up rattlesnake bite first aid on wikipedia. Though jumpy, we began to drift to sleep under another
starry desert night sky. Our uneasy sleep was not helped by the periodic howling of coyotes, which always seemed just a
bit closer than they had been before, but we made it through the night in one piece.

After our tense night, we rose soon after the sun came up. Our patch of desert 30 feet from the road seemed much less
sinister by the light of day, and we enjoyed a light-hearted morning with Chris, Matt and Mercedes joking about the
previous night. We planned on cranking out 120+ miles to get to Carson City in 2 days, so we left our companions behind
to bike at a faster pace.
Of course, 10 miles into the ride Matt got a flat tire, so by the time he had replaced his inner tube, the others had
caught up to us. Deciding we might as well ride together at this point, we regrouped and spent about 15 relaxed miles
riding together.
As we were biking, we saw a man with wild hair and a huge sack slung over his shoulder walking down the side of the
road. California Matt stopped to check if he was ok and later related to us the fascinating story of Jeroulde. Jeroulde
didn’t talk and communicated with facial expressions and by spelling out words on his hand. He had been walking around
the country alone for around 15 years, apparently as some sort of spiritual journey. He had been as far south as Mexico,
but thought it was too hot. California Matt offered him food, which he accepted without enthusiasm, and water which he
drank eagerly. We were awed by Jeroulde’s odyssey, but we still had mileage to do, and soon we lost sight of him behind
us, still walking alone across the vast, empty desert.
After a leisurely brunch break at a pavilion in the middle of nowhere (aka Nevada), we decided we were a bit behind
schedule, so we bid the Chris, Matt, and Mercedes goodbye and set out again with renewed vigor. Our determined pace
faced a stiff test in the ~2500 feet of climbing before Austin, and we rolled into the hillside town hot and weary.
We took the natural course of action and recuperated at a gas station with a half gallon of ice cream and some snacks.
Throughout our meal, several people and a dog came by to investigate the sweaty strangers devouring a tub of ice cream,
and we told them (except the dog) of our trip.
With great reluctance, we left the gas station around an hour later and resumed our push to get halfway to Carson City.
We passed the next 50 miles in a tired daze, with Peter pulling through the headwind and all of us peddling wordlessly,
while the dance hits of Cascada urged us on.
After an eternity of biking we saw the restaurant and rental cabins that make up Cold Springs Station. Though we had
intended to get in 13 more miles to Middlegate, some maternal women at the bar convinced us that it was a shady
alternative (Chris and Matt later stopped in Middlegate and said it was awesome). Grateful for an excuse to stop, we
rented a cabin for the night for $40, and ordered food. We dig into a massive dinner (Matt and Peter had giant burgers
and Charlie ate a whole pizza) under the eerie gaze of the numerous deer, elk, and pronghorn heads mounted on the wall.
after dinner, Matt gave us a needed laugh by trying to bike through loose gravel and doing a slow motion sideways
topple, with feet still clipped into pedals. We laughed at Matt, started our laundry, showered, and headed to bed
exhausted.

With an 125 mile day planned, we attempted to wake up early, but didn’t actually hit the road until 9. The ride took us
first towards Fallon, which was blessedly downhill. The road passed through the usual desolate desert and headwinds, but
we found the desert changing from the bush-covered scrubland we were used to a Sahara-like ocean of sand. We passed some
cryptically labeled military facilities like “Centroid testing facility” (we speculated that a centroid was some kind of
top secret fighting robot). There were even some helicopters and jets visible on their flights around the base, though
we didn’t see any of the B17 stealth bombers we, which had heard also use the base.
Leaving behind the military areas, we passed through more desert notable for the nearby “sand mountain” (giant sand
dune) and the countless messages spelled out on the sand with rocks by passersby. Biking through this interesting
landscape, we met one of our eastbound counterparts, Dietmar. Dietmar was a proud naturalized American, and spoke
enthusiastically about biking across the country. We agreed with his sentiment, but were grateful he was the one with 7
1/2 states to go and not us.
A bit further down the road, we saw a lone figure walking on the side with what looked like a baby stroller. We had
heard of some dude walking across the country, and we pulled over to meet the man behind the stories.
Jonah (blog: dudetrek) was very friendly and repeatedly complemented us for our long bike trip, despite have walked the
same distance and then some. Though his beard and demeanor made him seem older, he was younger than us at 19, and was
taking a year off after high school for self discovery. He told us some of his stories, like the time he befriended some
rafting guides in Moab and spent their day off rafting and partying with them. He even played us some Bob Marley on the
guitar he carried. We spent 20 fascinating minutes talking to him, and came away impressed with how down-to-earth and
normal he seemed for a guy WALKING from Delaware to California (for the record, he was 11 months in when we met him and
he still had a month to go).
After these interludes and a substantial amount of additional biking, we hit the tantalizing outskirts and finally the
city of Fallon (a teeming metropolis of 8000). We were again ravenous, and we annihilated a small mountain of Chinese
food, with Peter declaring it was the most he’d ever eaten at once.
With little time to waste, we returned to the road around 4, hoping to cover the 60 miles to Carson City before dark. We
could’ve probably done it too, but we decided to stop at WalMart for a new GoPro memory card, and then Matt got another
flat tire. We finally left again around 5, now needing some major speed to hit Carson City before dark.
Alas, the remaining miles did not cooperate, and we faced strong headwinds almost immediately. Charlie and then Matt
pulled, with everyone pushing their tired legs to try and make the most of the remaining daylight. At a snack stop in
Silver Springs, a family congratulated us on our trip, while an older man told us we “had a hell of a long way to San
Francisco.”
Resuming the ride, we began to run out of daylight still 15 miles from Carson City. We slowed down and turned on our
bike lights, but still hit some bumps going over trash on the side of the road. Still, after an hour of tired but
determined riding, we reached the promised land of Carson City. Like mana from heaven, we were greeted almost
immediately by the first Dairy Queen in over a thousand miles, and we wasted not time in ordering large blizzards and
food.
Feeling slightly rejuvenated, we spent about 30 minutes searching before finally finding an America’s Best Value Inn to
stop at. We hit a stroke of luck when the hotel clerk, Chris, heard we were going to Lake Tahoe in the morning a offered
to give us a ride since he was also headed that way. Tired, but excited to have made it and to have a rest day, we fell
fast asleep around 11:30.

        As promised, Chris met us early in the morning to drive us to Lake Tahoe. We were still tired from the previous two
        days, but getting up early was much less daunting without any biking planned for the day. Chris spent the drive talking
        to us about his time living in California, and his subsequent move to Carson City. We were surprised that anyone would
        willingly move from California to Nevada, but he assured us that there was nowhere else with such great skiing at such
        an affordable cost of living.
        
        Chris dropped us off at Zephyr Cove on the shore of Lake Tahoe, which we had previously determined was the cheapest
        place for watersport rentals. We stopped by the dock to make our parasailing reservations, and then returned to the
        Zephyr Cove restaurant to eat and pass the time until our appointment. The Zephyr Cove restaurant had delicious but
        significantly overpriced omelettes, and Matt decided to get his money’s worth by gorging on the complementary jam
        packets at our table. After 7 packets, he recovered only a little value, but at least he had his dignity.
        
        We finally left for parasailing around 11, along with a grandmother, mother, and granddaughter group. Charlie and Peter
        went first, and enjoyed a fun liftoff followed by a serene 5 minutes flying high above the brilliant blue lake and
        forested mountains. Not content to let us enjoy the flight dry, the captain dipped our “feet” (or lower halves of our
        bodies) in the freezing water before reeling us back in. Matt and Peter went for another ride and had a similar
        experience, but with an even bigger dunk in the lake.
        
        After parasailing, we passed time by eating overpriced french fries and playing beach volleyball with some locals while
        we waited for things to warm up for jet skiing. After the local high school kids exposed our complete loss of hand-eye
        coordination in volleyball, we decided it was time for jet skiing, but were disappointed to discover rentals had been
        cancelled for the day due to high winds.
        
        Content with our experience of Tahoe, we embarked to catch the bus back to Carson City. We had some difficulty finding
        the bus stop, and arrived just as our bus was pulling away. Fortunately there were two more buses for the day. We
        mistakenly believed that sitting at the bus stop would cause the bus driver to stop to pick us up, but an hour later we
        were traumatized by the long-awaited bus blowing straight by our stop. Finally, two hours after we decided to leave, we
        managed to catch the last bus with frantic waving and jumping around.
        
        The bus ride itself was a small adventure, featuring a homeless man who argued constantly with the driver about his
        rights to have more than one seat, and a boy in high school who seemed in awe of our trip so far. Returning to Carson
        City, we had a relaxing dinner at yet another Chinese restaurant (Charlie opted for Indian food), and returned to the
        motel more than ready to take on the Sierra Nevadas.

After our hard-earned rest day, we were energized and excited to push through our final biking hurdle, the Sierra
Nevada. We woke up relatively late, and after stocking up at the Family Dollar we set out along the scenic eastern side
of the mountains. The desert finally began to recede and we saw farms and even sparse forests on the mountainside. The
route also became steadily more uphill, and after a series of ever steeper hills we, took a pitstop at the last shop
before the mountain climb began in earnest.

At the store we celebrated our impending conquest with delicious cream soda and chips. As we left, a woman in the
parking lot asked if we could we could give her directions, and ingratiated herself by lecturing us about how much she
hated cyclists while we looked through our maps (while still on our bikes).

After this prelude, we began the big climb over the last mountains between us and the Pacific. We had been warned by
cyclists traveling from San Francisco of how challenging the Sierra Nevada was, but we had the advantages of starting at
almost 5,000 feet in elevation and having 7 weeks of biking under our belts. The mountain turned out to be no match for
our veteran legs and we raced through forests and alpine scenery towards Carson Pass. Peter was carrying the GoPro for
once, so Charlie was able to assume his natural role leading the charge.

After a brief celebration at the pass, we raced the daylight down the mountain towards the campsites near Kirkwood. We
pulled over at a restaurant on the side of the road, thinking we saw our loyal friends Chris, Matt, and Mercedes waving
at us. Upon stopping we realized the people waving at us were in fact a group of middle-aged women drinking. We struck
up a conversation with the group (whose names I unfortunately forget, but included another Charlie and “JP girl,” named
for her Japanese heritage), and told them about our trip. We mentioned how hungry we always were, and the women revealed
that they were actually lunch ladies from a California school district vacationing together in a nearby cabin. Perhaps
due to the beers or their lunch lady instincts, they graciously invited us back to their cabin to make camp and receive
free food. We convinced them to also invite Chris and Matt when they turned up, even though “those guys don’t look as
nice as you boys.”

Thrilled at our luck, we arrived at their cabin and were showered in homemade cookies and juicy quesadillas. After
stuffing ourselves, we all gathered around a campfire and made smores (with Reese’s cups instead of chocolate!) and
talked into the night. Amidst brilliant stars, lush California trees and good company, we felt utterly relaxed.

After our memorable night high in the mountains, we awoke energized for our 110 mile descent towards Sacramento. Matt
and Chris had left before we were up, but we thanked the lunch ladies and said our farewells before setting off.

We had convinced ourselves that the ride would be one giant downhill through beautiful California scenery, but we were
only half right, as the first few miles of the day were partially up some decent mountain ascents. Nonetheless, the
vistas across the forested and snow-capped mountains were awe-inspiring. We biked by crystal blue lakes, and as we
finally began to descend in altitude, we began to see green groves of especially large and impressive fir trees.

Despite the exquisite natural beauty, the shoddy state of the backroads began to wear on our enjoyment of the ride. We
were forced to ride our breaks and weave between potholes through much of the fir forest. Charlie even hit a pothole (as
anyone could have done!) and had to bike back a quarter mile to collect the belongings that had been knocked off the
back of the bike.

The descent eventually leveled out somewhat, and we emerged into an area that seemed to be a combination of Napa Valley
and Appalachia. There were vineyards and wineries all around, but also plenty of pickup trucks and people who talked
like they were from rural PA. One man rolled into a parking lot we were resting by, loudly arguing about his recent
purchase of a log-splitter with his girlfriend. The girlfriend stalked off to the bathroom, leaving the talkative guy to
loudly attempt to charm us into buying the logsplitter hitched to his truck. Despite his loud optimism, we determined
that we would not be able to bike effectively pulling a 500 lb log splitter.

The day began to drag on as the wilderness thinned out and we hit increasingly heavy traffic approaching Folsom. Our
mood was further dampened when a car stopped to ask us to call 911 for a car accident just a mile behind us (apparently
a drunk driver). After alerting the police, we continued on extra wary of the many cars packed onto the roads alongside
us.

The day reached its low point not long after the 911 incident as we failed to find the obscure entrance to the Folsom
bike path we were supposed to take. After 20 frustrating minutes of circling, we finally found the entrance hidden by
bushes in the back of a random gravel lot. Fortunately, the search proved worthwhile, as the bike path was well
maintained and the sun glinting off the river and through the path-side grass gave everything a beautiful golden tint.

With daylight running low, we needed a push to cover the remaining 20 miles to Sacramento. We were starting to feel the
day’s 100 miles, but our motivation was jump-started when another cyclist passed us for the first time in the entire
trip! Despite our long day and heavy bags, we took to the challenge, pedaling close to 25 mph for several minutes to run
our rival down. We had nearly caught him when the rogue cyclist abruptly turned off the bike path towards town, causing
Matt to bitterly remark on the cyclist’s poor sportsmanship.

With just a few miles left and barely any daylight, we continued to bike hard, crossing the bridge into Sacramento just
as the sun set, before collapsing into bed at a conveniently placed Super 8.

We ate breakfast at the Super8 confident of reaching San Francisco within the day. Peter made extra certain of it by
drinking 4 cups of coffee, a big step up from his usual 0. We then set out along the aptly named Yolo bike path (if you
are too old for that reference), with only 60 miles between us and the Vallejo ferry.

The bike path dropped us off in Davis, which reminded us of long-lost State College. Near Davis, we ran into Matt and
Chris once again, and enjoyed a relaxing ride with them through the fruit farms of the Central Valley.

After a traditional bike trip lunch at Subway, we arbitrarily decided to try to make it to Vallejo in time for the 2:00
ferry. Though there were later ferries that would not require as much of a rush, we figured it would be fitting end to
the trip to give ourselves a bit of a challenge. We made plans with Chris and Matt to meet in San Francisco, and hit the
road to Vallejo with new energy.

The first 20 or so miles went according to plan, but we began to hit some rolling hills outside of Vallejo that put our
2:00 arrival in jeopardy. As we ascended a surprisingly intimidating hill overlooking the city, we realized we had less
than 15 minutes to cover 5 miles through hills and stoplights to reach the ferry in time. Fortunately,
caffeine-invigorated Peter took command and set a breakneck pace through Vallejo. Matt and Charlie later agreed that
they though their hearts might explode, but with some fortunate green lights and 50 days of training under our belts, we
made it to the ferry with 2 minutes to spare.

After a well earned rest on the ferry we were dropped off in San Francisco. After spending 50 days almost entirely in
rural backcountry and the outskirts of cities, we were overwhelmed by the bustling Embarcadero. There were techie
looking people wearing Google Glass, sharply dressed professionals, and way more girls our age than we were used to. We
soaked in the impending accomplishment of our goal before pulling into the disconcertingly well-designed bike lane to
head to the Pacific Ocean.

City biking took a bit of an adjustment, and more than once we had locals fly by us while we stopped at stop signs or
waited for idled Pedicabs to move. After several fits and starts, and getting directions from some friendly old men
sitting near the Golden Gate Bridge, we finally found our way to Baker Beach on the Pacific Ocean! We celebrated by
taking pictures, before enduring a chilly wait for Matt and Chris to show up with some friends they were meeting.

Once the others arrived, we reveled together in our feat, and of course took more pictures. After we got too cold for
that, we left the beach and biked our last few miles to a hostel. Matt and Chris gave us a fascinating tour of the city
along the the way before leaving us at a fancy Chinese restaurant. Though pricy, the meal felt thoroughly earned, and we
ended the day happy and excited for our remaining adventures in California.

With our long journey finally over, we capped off the trip with a weeklong California vacation. Charlie’s sister’s
roommate Jenna and her family were kind enough to host us in their home in Mill Valley, just across the Golden Gate
Bridge. Jenna showed us the area’s excellent vegetarian food and beautiful overlooks, as well as treating our weary legs
to sweet, sweet car rides.

After our time with Jenna, we met up with our nerd friend Doug, who was in Palo Alto for an internship. At Doug’s we
spent an embarrassing amount of time lounging around and enjoying being lazy. In between chill-out sessions, we found
time to tour San Francisco, where we tackled a Vermonster (30 scoops of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream plus way too many
toppings), mostly thanks to Matt. We also travelled to Yosemite National Park with Doug and soaked in the spectacular
vistas and top-notch Facebook profile picture opportunities. And in a final adventure that seemed vaguely relevant to
being in California, we went skydiving.

Looking back, it seems surreal that we biked 3800 miles, from struggling to put up tents in the dark our first day in
coastal Virginia, to arriving in San Francisco 50 later, sorer, and beardier. It was hard, but it was also deeply
rewarding. We will always remember the hippy commune in Virginia, Pastor Joe’s hospitality and conspiracy theories, and
our bonfire with the California lunch ladies. We bonded through shared hardship and triumph, and broke up our
(relatively) normal lives with a big, fat adventure. Thank you to Dr. Page/Dad, the Saackes, the Bergers, the Danskies,
the Tuttles, the Doug, and everyone else who helped us along the way!
