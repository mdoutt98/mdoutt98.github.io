                 We were all a bit giddy setting off and made it a whole quarter mile before we saw some bamboo, which caused us to stop
                for pictures. Peter successfully did a human flag in his America pants, which was very exciting. Since we were off to a
                late start, we only made it 30 miles, but got to see some picturesque rivers and forests. We were a bit late getting
                into the national park, so it was dark and cold, but on the bright side we saw several deer right on the path, and even
                got some blurry footage of them.
                
                At the national park, we were fortunate to meet the Grace Covenant Presbyterian group that was staying there. They
                offered us a spot to pitch our tents on their campsite, and helped Charlie pitch his tent, which he was having some
                trouble with. It was a good, if short, start to the trip.

                The Grace Covenent Presbyterian group spoiled us with a hot breakfast of pancakes, bacon, and omelettes in the morning.
                After eating and hanging out with them a bit, we hit the road around 9.
                
                We made good time through the countryside surrounding Richmond. We saw a lot of signs for plantations and monuments to
                people like John Tyler, one of the less interesting Presidents. We got lost for over an hour around midday, causing us
                to lose time, but some helpful locals pointed us in the right direction. This was unfortunately along a busy highway, so
                we walked our bikes a few miles rather than hazard the traffic.
                
                As dusk fell we weren’t near any large towns, but luckily the pastor of Mount Olivet Baptist Church was still there and
                allowed us to camp on their property. We ended up in the small barn they use for nativity scenes, lending the night a
                weird kind of symbolism.

                We left before church started at 8:15 and once again were making great progress through some beautiful farmland, until
                Charlie’s chain broke (through no fault of his own). We spent about two hours on some guy’s lawn trying to fix it.
                Several people offered help, but we were sure we could handle it. We finally gave up after two heartbreaking near-fixes.
                
                At that point, we decided to accept the help of Sapphyre, a very cool passerby who had left her number. She drove to
                pick us up and took us back to Twin Oaks community, which is one of the oldest conscientious living communities in
                America. We got to meet DH, who fixed Charlie’s chain in about 5 minutes, and another community member who had biked to
                California and back.
                
                After our interesting side trip, we still managed 85 miles on the day and spent the night in Charlottesville. The Budget
                Inn has never seemed nicer.

            We got off to a late start because we had to go to a bike shop to get Charlie’s chain looked at. After stocking up on
            repairs/supplies at the bike shop, we had a delicious lunch at Chipotle and finally started biking around 1:30.
            We had a tough climb up the mountains to get on the Blue Ridge Parkway, but were rewarded with some breathtaking views.
            After a hard afternoon, we made it to a peak at 3200 feet where we made camp at a picnic site off the side of the
            parkway.

            We were trying to make it as close to Blacksburg as possible to stay the night with the Saackes, so we left early in the
            morning around 7:15. We had a nice, long descent, and spent midmorning at Gertie’s Country store. We met some friendly
            locals who were interested in our trip, as well as Gary, an Irishman and fellow transamerican cyclist. We signed our
            names on the wall of the store to go with the hundreds of other signatures of travelers from around the world.
            
            The rest of the day was rolling hills, and very hot, but we managed to average ~17 mph for a lot of it. By around mile
            85 we were starting to feel tired, but we pushed on the last ~20 miles a slower pace.
            
            Finally we reached our meeting point where Dr. Saacke came to pick us up. He and Mrs. Saacke were wonderful hosts,
            giving us as much pasta as we could eat and giving us much needed access to laundry and shower facilities. We all
            collapsed into bed around 10, exhausted but very happy to be here.

            We had a delicious breakfast with the Saackes. We were tired from the day before and really enjoying their hospitality,
            so we stayed late and also had a delicious lunch.
            We finally left around 2:30 and had a relaxed day going mostly downhill. As the day drew to a close, Matt was very
            excited to see the first Dairy Queen of the trip. We finally pitched camp at the max meadows fire station. The
            firefighters there were very friendly and showed us their fireman suits. They even offered to let is use their showers,
            but we declined, since showers on two days in a row is pretty excessive.

            We broke camp early from the fire station and set out to make up some mileage. Mount Rogers is officially the best
            mountain; it goes up at a moderate incline, and the downhill lasts forever. We had some ice cream in Damascus that was
            possibly even better than at Dairy Queen.
            Our day ended with the pleasant discovery of a church with it’s doors open to cyclists. There are Dutch cyclists we
            didn’t see much, as well as two fellow Americans. Eric just graduated from CMU in philosophy and said he was biking
            across the country to “put off real life for as long as possible,” and because he likes to travel. Al is a 63 year old
            engineer from Long Island who said he was biking across the country “because I’m old.” We were impressed with their
            fortitude for doing the trip solo.

        After endless hills and lots of gas station food, we finally made it to Kentucky. Along the way we stopped at Breaks
        Interstate Park, whose incredible views almost made up for it’s disgustingly steep climbs.
        We spent the night at the Frieda Harris Baptist Center, which hosts cyclists and provides showers, food, and a
        basketball court, all for free. Thanks to this wonderful hospitality, we spent the evening enjoying a pathetic game of
        basketball and chef Charlie’a famous extra-watery Mac n cheese.
        We also met Reed and Ethan, two fellow cyclists staying the night. They are brothers from Arizona, ages 16 and 21. They
        were very friendly and we traded tips on how to escape the rampant unleashed dogs that chase our bikes. We were also
        impressed with the fundraising they were doing for the children’s hospital in Phoenix.

        After a final homemade breakfast of canned beans and milk, we left the Freeda Harris Baptist Center hoping the worst of
        the hills were behind us. Two miles into our ride, we hit a formation that blurred the distinction between a hill and a
        cliff and continued for at least a half mile. As we strained up the cliff/hill in our lowest gear, we passed several
        other cyclists walking their bikes up.
        At the top, we talked with the other cyclists and discovered they were with a tour group of 16 people and doing the same
        route as us. This would be the first of many encounters throughout the day with the Adventure Cycling group, and Matt
        soon made it his mission to catch them all. Among the more interesting members of their party was a man from England who
        found American wildlife, such as roadkill raccoons and roadkill skunks very exotic. We also met a retired couple riding
        a tandem bike who informed us that they had crossed the country twice before by bike, and that the route we were on was
        by far the worst terrain-wise.
        After this less than encouraging exchange, we were pleased to spend most of the rest of the day going downhill. There
        was even a driver who met us at a gas station who apologized very earnestly for having passed us rudely earlier in the
        day. Though we did not remember the incident in question, the sentiment was appreciated and raised our opinion of
        Kentucky.
        We ended the day in a town with the colorful name of Hazard. We stayed at the Combs Motel, which was vaguely reminiscent
        of the Bates Motel from Psycho. After a dinner of Chinese buffet, we felt very pampered nonetheless.

        We left Hazard a bit late around 9:45. The forecast called for the first rain of the trip, which materialized about 15
        miles into the trip. We huddled under cover at a gas station with several of the adventure cycling guys. One of the
        cyclists we met somewhat gleefully displayed his hobby of supergluing pennies to various locations. He informed us that
        he was attempting to glue pennies throughout the route, which struck Charlie as very subtly diabolical, and Matt as
        awesome.
        After wiring out the worst of the rain, we traveled over several hills, which were gradually starting to get smaller. We
        entered an awkward cycle of passing with the Adventure Cyclists, with is slowly passing them on the uphills, and them
        passing us as we cautiously rode our brakes on the wet downhills. Who would have thought 60 year old men would be more
        reckless than a group of college students? It took all of our self control not to race and chase them down.
        Due to the rain, we decided to end the day early in McKee. There we found the second Dairy Queen of the trip, leading an
        excited Matt to make the goal of getting a blizzard at every DQ on our route. We spent the night at yet another motel,
        which makes us officially spoiled

            The day started with THE BEST HILL EVER. Outside of Berea, the road extended downhill at 6 percent grade for two miles
            (we know because there was a sign), and the road was silky smooth with no traffic. We were all exhilarated after five
            minutes of flying down, and our mood was further lifted as we rode through the beautiful town of Berea. We gorged at a
            pizza buffet and set off through the increasingly modest hills with a much higher view of Kentucky, which had been at a
            low through the unleashed dog infested Appalachians.
            After lunch, we accidentally made our first big wrong turn since Virginia. Though nobody was at fault, Peter did have
            the maps and was the one telling us where to turn. Not to point any fingers, but we can probably say with certainty that
            Charlie and Matt did nothing wrong.
            After realizing Peter’s the mistake, we decided to make lemonade from our navigational lemons and make our route into a
            shortcut. Though at times we had to ride on about a foot of shoulder, we actually ends up making good time on an ever
            flatter landscape. By 7:30, we pulled into the campground at Bardstown (DQ count: 4), having biked about 108 miles and
            shaving 10 miles from the designated route. Overall, it was probably our best day of biking yet.
